# Disktroy

This software communicates with the user through the terminal.
That's why POSIX functions and header files are included.
For this interacting with the terminal, the file system it's
going to use should be compatible with UNIX format.
That's why here Linux File System is used. So, there is
linux/fs.h header file included in the disktroy.c in src directory
